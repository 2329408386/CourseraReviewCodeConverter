Project Name: Coursera's Review Code Converter

Description:This idea came from a course in Coursera. There is a part in my course "Beginning Game Programming with C#(Dr Tim)", everyone should check other 5 peers' code. But when I start checking the first person's code, I find his code is in mess, then second one, the third one. They are all in mess. That made me mad. Then I think for a while, "Maybe the web want to save space and they change the format of students' code", I think. Compare these code for a while, I find some regularity. So I write a project with C++ to change the format into a readable way. 
I'm also a beginner of programming, there must be many details which I cannot change. So I hope we can work together.

Table of Contents: None

Installation:You just need a compiler, that's OK enough. I create it in MS Visual Studio, But it can also work with GNU++, which I make a simple test.

Usage:There are 5 files in total."Convertor.h","Convertor.cpp","Convertor2.h","Convertor2.cpp","test.cpp". You just need to download them and compile them.

Contributing:Hope my dear readers can contribute your wisdom to my first project in Github(smile face).
